# Marine-Plastic-Pollution
Forecasting of global plastic production and analysis of the factors responsible for ocean pollution.
## Abstarct
The amount of plastic enters the ocean is doubling every year. Factors that are mainly responsible for this increasing rate are still unknown or ignored. With the help of comprehensive data on different plastics disposal methods, the rate of plastic waste, coastal populations, and plastic production rate, we are trying to estimate factors that are responsible for polluting the earthâ€™s environment. Plastic Production is a vital element of this environmental problem; Its global production rate reached 359 Million metric tons in the year 2018. If waste management techniques are not improved or taken seriously, marine life will be in the most significant trouble. With the help of different forecasting techniques, we are going to find out the global plastic production rate for upcoming years, hoping it will help us identify potential environmental problems.
